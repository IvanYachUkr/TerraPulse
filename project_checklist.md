| `[x]`  | Done |
| ⚠️     | Grading-critical / mandatory |
| 🏆     | Bonus / extra credit |

---

## Phase 0 — Project Setup & Reproducibility ⚠️

- [x] Create GitHub repo + clean structure
- [x] `.gitignore` (geodata + large rasters excluded)
- [x] `requirements.txt` exists
- [ ] Reproducible install test on a clean env (fresh venv) ⚠️
- [ ] Add a single “run-all” entrypoint (Makefile / run.sh) 🏆
- [ ] Ensure no raw data is in git history ⚠️

---

## Phase 1 — Problem Framing & Scope Definition ⚠️

- [x] Define land-cover classes (WorldCover → 6 final classes)
- [x] Define spatial unit: **100m × 100m**
- [x] Define temporal setup:
  - Labels: 2020 (v100), 2021 (v200)
  - Unlabeled: 2022–2025 (Sentinel-only, forward prediction for dashboard)
- [x] Define target task:
  - Multi-output regression: predict 6 proportions per cell (sum≈1)
  - Change Δ derived from predictions: Δ = p(T2) − p(T1)
- [x] Define intended user + non-allowed decisions (limitations)
- [ ] Write **Scope Document** (`reports/scope.md`) ⚠️
  - Must include the *algorithm version shift* caveat (v100 → v200)

---

## Phase 2 — Data Acquisition & Preprocessing ⚠️

### 2A — Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composites ⚠️
- [x] Download seasonal composites for **6 labeled periods**:
  - 2020: spring, summer, autumn
  - 2021: spring, summer, autumn
- [x] All 6 composites verified:
  - Geometry assertion: CRS/transform/shape match canonical anchor
  - Sizes ~85–88 MB each
- [x] Known runtime issues fixed in pipeline:
  - `rescale=False` stackstac dtype/scale conflict
  - dtype / NaN fill-value compatibility
  - dask-aware finite checks

### 2B — WorldCover Labels ⚠️
- [x] Download WorldCover 2020 v100 tile N48E009
- [x] Download WorldCover 2021 v200 tile N48E009
- [x] Reprojected to Sentinel anchor grid (nearest)
- [x] Class mapping (11 → 6 classes)
- [x] **Important limitation** ⚠️:
  - v100 vs v200 algorithm difference may create “fake change” signals

### 2C — InputQuality layer (optional)
- [x] Investigated InputQuality availability
- [x] **Decision: skip for now** (not public for our tile)
  - Use `valid_fraction` as the quality proxy
  - Can add InputQuality later without refactoring

### 2D — OSM Auxiliary Data 🏆
- [x] Downloaded OSM datasets (buildings/roads/landuse/natural/water)
- [x] Saved as GeoPackages in `data/raw/osm/`
- [ ] Decide final usage:
  - Option A: merge OSM once at final dataset stage (recommended)
  - Option B: suffix OSM per composite (creates lots of zero deltas)

---

## Phase 3 — Canonical Grid + Labels (Anchor-based) ⚠️

- [x] Create canonical anchor raster (Phase 1 artifact)
- [x] Build grid from anchor blocks:
  - **100m cells = 10×10 pixels**
  - **186 cols × 161 rows = 29,946 cells**
  - `cell_id` row-major, contiguous 0..N-1
  - Output: `data/processed/v2/grid.gpkg`
  - **Grid size justification (retrospective analysis):**
    - Connected-component analysis of pixel-level change (2020→2021) in the AOI:
      76% of changed regions are ≤4 pixels, median = 2 px (200 m²)
    - At 100m (100 px/cell), these tiny artifacts → 1–4% proportion noise, naturally smoothed out
    - Real change (≥50 px regions, ~1.5% of regions) still produces 15–25% proportion shifts per cell
    - Smaller cells (e.g. 50m = 25 px) would amplify label artifacts to ~16% per cell
    - Larger cells (e.g. 200m) would halve sample count to ~7,500 — too few for spatial CV
    - **100m is the sweet spot: noise-smoothing + sufficient samples + spatial granularity**
- [x] Aggregate label proportions per cell:
  - `data/processed/v2/labels_2020.parquet`
  - `data/processed/v2/labels_2021.parquet`
- [x] Compute change labels:
  - `data/processed/v2/labels_change.parquet` (delta = 2021−2020)

---

## Phase 4 — Feature Engineering (per composite) ⚠️

### 4A — Core features (done) ⚠️

  - Never drops `cell_id`
  - `cell_id → (row_idx, col_idx)` computed deterministically
  - Reflectance scale auto-detected (likely /10000) for texture assumptions
  - Control flags:
    - `valid_fraction`, `low_valid_fraction`
    - `reflectance_scale`
    - `full_features_computed`
- [x] Core feature set per composite:
  - Band stats: mean/std/min/max/median/q25/q75/finite_frac × 10 bands
  - Indices: NDVI/NDWI/NDBI/NDMI/NBR/SAVI/BSI/NDRE1/NDRE2 (stats)
  - Tasseled cap (brightness/greenness/wetness)
  - Spatial simple (edges, Laplacian, Moran’s I, NDVI spread)
- [x] Outputs produced for all 6 composites:
  - 29,946 rows each
  - **143 non-cell columns** (139 real features + 4 control cols)
  - Low valid fraction rates: ~0.2%–1.7% depending on season

### 4B — Full feature set (done) ⚠️
- [x] Full extraction completed (heavy features):
  - GLCM texture
  - Gabor
  - LBP histogram + entropy
  - HOG
  - Morphological profile features
  - Semivariogram features (+ fit params)
- [x] Full outputs verified:
  - All 6 composites: 29,946 cells × 239 columns (238 features + cell_id)
  - Identical `cell_id` set across all composites
  - `full_features_computed` = 1 for non-low-VF cells
  - Scale detected as 10000 across all composites

### 4C — Known fixed bugs (documentable as “data issues”) ⚠️
- [x] Bug 1: reflectance scaling mismatch (0..10000 vs 0..1 assumptions)
- [x] Bug 2: dropping cells based on quality threshold (join corruption risk)
- [x] Bug 3: cell_id order / mapping mismatch risk (row/col alignment)
- [x] Bug 4: imputation scope accidentally touching metadata columns

---

## Phase 5 — Merge + Delta Features (YOY + Seasonal Contrasts) ⚠️

### 5A — Core merge/deltas (done) ⚠️
- [x] Load all 6 composite feature tables
- [x] Build wide table with suffixes: `{feature}_{year}_{season}`
- [x] Compute deltas:
  - YoY: 2021−2020 per season → `delta_yoy_{season}_{feat}`
  - Seasonal contrasts within each year → `delta_{year}_{sB}_vs_{sA}_{feat}`
- [x] Output:
  - `data/processed/v2/features_merged_core.parquet`
  - **29,946 rows × 2,110 columns**
  - 0% NaN after imputation (expected; indicators preserve quality info)

### 5B — Full merge/deltas (done) ⚠️
- [x] Run compute_deltas.py on `feature-set=full`
- [x] Output:
  - `data/processed/v2/features_merged_full.parquet`
  - **29,946 rows × 3,535 columns** (660 MB)
  - 1,429 base + 702 YoY + 1,404 seasonal deltas
  - 0% NaN after imputation
- [x] Defensive checks:
  - Year ordering sorted (prevent sign flip)
  - Feature set intersection across composites (warn on mismatch)
  - Delta symmetry spot-checked on random cells

---

  - [x] Imputation scope (fixed)
  - [x] Choose one NOT fixed: **WorldCover v100→v200 label-version shift** ⚠️
    - Justify: cannot correct without alternative ground truth; treat as label noise + discuss
- [x] Save all figures to `reports/phase6/core/figures/` ⚠️
- [x] Hardened with 20+ defensive guardrails:
  - Row alignment + cross-table cell_id assertions

  - CRS projection + grid geometry + row-major assumptions validated
  - NaN/Inf guards, numeric dtype filtering, empty-data guards
  - CLASS_COLORS/CLASS_NAMES/COMPOSITES consistency asserts

---

## Phase 7 — Train/Test Split Design (avoid spatial leakage) ⚠️

- [x] Implement a spatially-aware split ⚠️
  - Tile-based blocked split: 10×10 cells (1 km²), 323 tile groups, 5-fold
  - Split indices saved to `data/processed/v2/split_spatial.parquet`
  - Metadata: `data/processed/v2/split_spatial_meta.json` (full repro params)

  - Morton Z-curve: R²=0.527 (gap +0.240)
  - Region growing: R²=0.429 (gap +0.338)

  - Morton: connected=NO (fragments on 17×19), max_dev=27.9%, compactness=1.765
  - Region growing: connected=YES, max_dev=2.1%, compactness=1.871
- [x] Exported tables: `leakage_comparison.csv`, `buffer_sweep.csv`, `fold_contiguity.csv`
- [x] Fold maps: grouped, contiguous, Morton, region growing
- [x] Unit tests: 14 invariant tests in `tests/test_splitting.py` (all pass in ~3s)
  - Partition correctness, tile integrity, connectedness, balance, determinism,
    buffer no-overlap, n_starts overflow, metrics schema
- [x] Hardening fixes applied:
  - Morton: explicit uint64 + bit extraction (no signed overflow risk)
  - Region growing: multi-start + scoring, n_starts guard, tile integrity assert
  - Leakage comparison: fold-size guard for degenerate folds
  - Buffer_m: `max(tile_h, tile_w)` for non-square tile safety
  - Compactness: isoperimetric scaling `boundary_edges / sqrt(n_tiles)`
  - Metadata: region growing params recorded for reproducibility

## Phase 8 — Modeling ⚠️

> At least 2 models: one interpretable + one flexible.

- [x] Target: predict 2021 proportions from merged 2020+2021 seasonal features
- [x] Model 1 (interpretable) ⚠️ — Ridge baseline
  - Ridge CV R²≈0.43 (region growing + buffer) — anchors "no leakage" claim
- [/] Model 2 (flexible) ⚠️ — Trees + MLPs
- [/] Hyperparameter tuning (time-boxed) ⚠️
- [ ] Compare models (performance vs interpretability)

### Model comparison (all evaluated with spatial CV + buffer)

| Model | R² (uniform) | MAE (pp) | Notes |
|-------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Ridge | 0.527 | 5.21 | Interpretable baseline |
| ElasticNet | 0.434 | 5.43 | Sparse, but worse than Ridge |
| ExtraTrees | 0.675 | 3.34 | Best tree model (2109 feat) |
| RF | 0.684 | 3.23 | Competitive tree model |
| CatBoost | 0.671 | 4.00 | Gradient boosted, lag on MAE |
| **MLP (Phase 8 best)** | **0.752** | **2.92** | Plain MLP, single fold |

### Tree results (28 configs, complete — `trees_reduced_features.csv`)
- Best: **ExtraTrees R²=0.692**, MAE=3.13pp (`all_core`, 2109 features)
- RF: R²=0.684 | CatBoost: R²=0.671 (but best Aitchison=4.19)
- Feature sets: `all_core` barely beats `bands_and_indices` (798 feats)
- Trees plateau at ~0.69 regardless of ensemble size or feature set

### MLP V2 sweep (superseded by V4)
- Best: **relu L5 h256 R²=0.858**, MAE=2.55pp (`bands_indices`, 798 feats)
- MLP–Tree gap: **+0.17 R²** on fold-0 (0.86 vs 0.69), **+0.09 R²** on CV means — MLPs learn cross-spectral interactions trees cannot
- ⚠️ V2 had BatchNorm confound on ReLU — fixed in V4

### MLP V4 search sweep (complete — 1549/1584 configs, fold-0 only)
- Script: `scripts/run_mlp_overnight_v4.py --stage search` (fold-0, 120 epochs)
- Best overall: **`residual_gelu_L6_d512_bn` R²=0.8634**, MAE=2.64pp
- Feature set ablation (best R² per set):
  | Rank | Feature Set | Features | Best R² |
  |------|---|---|---|
  | 1 | `bands_indices` | 798 | **0.8634** |
  | 2 | `bands_indices_glcm_lbp` | ~900 | 0.8598 |
  | 3 | `bands_indices_texture` | ~1100 | 0.8432 |
  | 4 | `full_no_deltas` | ~1400 | 0.8313 |
  | 5 | `bands_indices_hog` | ~850 | 0.8309 |
  | 6 | `all_full` | 3535 | 0.7952 |
  | 7 | `top500_full` | 500 | 0.6841 |
  | 8 | `texture_all` | ~300 | 0.6340 |
- Key finding: **more features = worse performance** — textures add noise at 100m resolution
- Architecture insights: residual + GELU + BatchNorm + lower LR (0.0005) wins
- Auto-CV launcher: `scripts/launch_cv_after_search.py` polls search → selects
  top 20 global + top 10 per feature set → launches CV (300 epochs × 5 folds)

### MLP V4 CV (complete — 83 configs × 5 folds = 415 runs)
- [x] CV complete
- Top 5 configs (5-fold mean ± std):
  | Rank | Config | R² mean | R² std | MAE | Epochs |
  |------|--------|---------|--------|-----|--------|
  | 1 | `bands_indices_glcm_lbp_plain_mish_L5_d512_bn` | **0.775** | 0.074 | 2.49 | 300 (cap!) |
  | 2 | `bands_indices_residual_silu_L10_d256_nonorm` | **0.772** | 0.050 | 2.52 | 297 (cap!) |
  | 3 | `full_no_deltas_plain_gelu_L5_d512_bn` | **0.771** | 0.035 | 2.65 | 280 |
  | 4 | `bands_indices_plain_silu_L5_d512_bn` | **0.771** | 0.054 | 2.45 | 300 (cap!) |
  | 5 | `bands_indices_texture_plain_silu_L5_d256_bn` | 0.767 | 0.033 | 2.62 | 295 |
- Key observations:
  - Many top configs hit the **300-epoch cap** — potentially undertrained
  - `bands_indices` (798 feat) and `bands_indices_glcm_lbp` (924 feat) dominate
  - Plain architectures (mish, silu) + BN competitive with residual deep networks
  - Fold-0 R²=0.86 drops to CV mean 0.77 → **~0.09 fold variance** indicates spatial heterogeneity
- [/] Final model selection from CV results

### MLP V5 deep training (complete — 233 runs, 5.7h)
- Script: `scripts/run_mlp_v5_deep_train.py`
- Results: `reports/phase8/tables/mlp_v5_deep.csv`, `mlp_v5_deep_summary.csv`
- 233 runs across 5 folds, 3 feature sets, 2000-epoch cap (all early-stopped, none hit cap)
- **Best 5-fold CV models (R² mean ± std):**
  1. `glcm_lbp_plain_silu_L5_d1024_bn` — **R²=0.787±0.041**, MAE=2.51pp
  2. `bands_indices_plain_mish_L5_d512_bn` — R²=0.769±0.065, MAE=2.49pp

  4. `bands_indices_residual_silu_L10_d256_nonorm` — R²=0.768±0.054, MAE=2.51pp
  5. `full_no_deltas_plain_mish_L5_d512_bn` — R²=0.762±0.040, MAE=2.67pp
- **Key findings:**
  - `bands_indices_glcm_lbp` (924 feat) beats `bands_indices` (798 feat) — GLCM+LBP texture helps
  - `full_no_deltas` (1428 feat) is worst — Gabor/HOG/morph/semivariogram add noise
  - Shallow plain (L5) dominates; deep residual (L12-16) competitive but not better
  - SiLU is the best activation; Mish close second; GeGLU catastrophically unstable
  - Texture features reduce fold-to-fold variance (±0.041 vs ±0.065)
  - Fold R² ranges: F0=0.86 (urban), F1=0.77 (mixed), F2=0.77 (forest), F3=0.73 (suburban), F4=0.83 (dense forest)
- [x] V5 results complete

### MLP V10: Definitive feature+architecture+head sweep (running)
- Script: `scripts/run_mlp_v10_definitive.py`
- 3 feature sets × 3 architectures (SiLU) × ILR + 6 GeGLU runs = 15 configs × 5 folds = 75 runs
- Feature sets: bi_LBP (864f), bi_MP_Gabor (996f), bi_LBP_MP_Gabor (1060f)
- Key V10 findings (fold 0):
  - SiLU architectures dominate GeGLU, especially for Dirichlet head
  - bi_MP_Gabor L5 d1024 bn: strong all-rounder
  - Texture features (LBP, MP+Gabor) DO help at 10×10 — previous "underperform" assessment was wrong

### MLP V11: New Gabor v2 + Morph DMP + Dirichlet (queued, auto-starts after V10)
- Script: `scripts/run_mlp_v11_new_texture.py`
- 7 configs × 5 folds = 35 runs (~2h):
  | # | Features | Architecture | Head |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | bi_Gab2_DMP (~1566f) | L5 d1024 bn | ILR |
  | 2 | bi_Gab2_DMP | L5 d1024 bn | Dirichlet |
  | 3 | bi_LBP_Gab2_DMP (~1632f) | L5 d1024 bn | ILR |
  | 4 | bi_Gab2_DMP | L5 d1536 bn | ILR |
  | 5 | bi_Gab2_DMP | L7 d1024 bn | ILR |
  | 6 | bi_Gab2_DMP | L5 d1536 bn | Dirichlet |
  | 7 | bi_LBP_Gab2_DMP | L5 d1536 bn | ILR |
- New texture features: complex Gabor magnitude+phase (384f) + Morph DMP peak/valley (384f)
- Supplemental parquet: `features_texture_v2.parquet` (extracted via `extract_texture_v2.py`)

### Future: V6 deep+wide architecture sweep
- Test unexplored architecture region: L12-16 × d512-1024
- V5 shows shallow wide (L5×d1024) is the overall winner architecture
- Incorporate new spectral indices (EVI2, MNDWI, GNDVI, NDTI, IRECI, CRI1)
- Feature ablation study complete — RedEdge+VegIdx+TC (348 feat) achieves 98.6% of full bands+indices with half the features

### Future: V6/V7 advanced spectral indices
- Add to `spectral_indices()` in `extract_features.py`, then re-extract:
  - **MNDWI** = (Green − SWIR1)/(Green + SWIR1) — better water in urban areas
  - **EVI2** = 2.5×(NIR − Red)/(NIR + 2.4×Red + 1) — less saturated than NDVI
  - **NDTI** = (SWIR1 − SWIR2)/(SWIR1 + SWIR2) — cropland vs bare soil
  - **IRECI** = (B07 − B04)/(B05/B06) — Sentinel-2-specific red-edge chlorophyll
  - **GNDVI** = (NIR − Green)/(NIR + Green) — chlorophyll-sensitive
  - **CRI1** = (1/Green) − (1/RE1) — carotenoid content
- Note: NDMI ≈ −NDBI (redundant), SAVI ≈ NDVI — consider dropping duplicates
- Test new `bands_indices_v2` feature set vs current `bands_indices`

  - Raster I/O: `gdal` crate (C-speed reads, no Python overhead)
  - Numerical: `ndarray` + BLAS (NumPy-equivalent)
  - Parallelism: `rayon` for data-parallel cell processing across all CPU cores
  - Gabor/Morph/LBP: port ~500 lines of Python to compiled Rust
  - Expected speedup: 20-50× over Python (CPU), 100×+ with GPU path
- [ ] ONNX model export + Rust inference via `ort` crate
  - Export trained PyTorch model → ONNX
  - Inference in Rust: no Python runtime needed at serving time
- [ ] Docker deployment
  - Multi-stage build: `rust:latest` → `debian:slim` (~30 MB final image)
  - Or fully static musl binary → `FROM scratch` (~10 MB image)
